Last week I completed  reading  [Designing  Web Interfaces](http://goo.gl/2oNh  "http://goo.gl/2oNh") co-authored by Bill Scott/Theresa Neil from [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/ "http://oreilly.com/"). The  book  is not  about  the visual  design  or information architecture but it  talks  about  the  standards  for interaction  design,  patterns  and  principles  for  creating  websites.

The  book  is  divided  into six  chapters, and each  chapter  describes  a  design  principle  with a step-by-step walkthrough of the  principles. Designing  Web Interfaces  is  an handy  293 pages guide for anyone who works on  developing  designs/creating web interfaces. Over here is an excerpt from the book.

> This  book  is  about  interaction  design: specifically, interaction pattern on the Web. And even more specifically, about rich  interaction  design  on the Web.

**Principle 1: Make It Direct**  
Discuss  about the  in-page  editing,  drag  and  drop  and on applying actions to directly selected objects in a  page. It's  also  covers  on making  everything on a  page  is clear and what can't be modified/edited  on it. 
  
**Principle 2: Keep it Lightweight**  
This chapter talks about the  best  practices for to  keep  each and every  action  on a  page  in a  convenient  way and to  provide  sufficient  feedback. It also covers on  using  the  contextual  tools and secondary menus and their  impact  on user interactions.
  
**Principle 3: Stay on the Page**  
Its focuses on where to employ the interaction techniques like overlays, inlays, virtual pages and process flow. On using overlays or refreshing a part of a page technique can be used to avoid opening of a new page for secondary information.
  
**Principle 4: Provide an Invitation**  
Focus is on teaching the principles of serving visitors to discover the possibilities on a site. By  providing cards  and a  live  tour of the site features. It  covers  the  usage  of static/dynamic invitations on the  web.
  
**Principle 5: Use Transitions**  
This  chapter  instructs  us about the  usage  of  animation,  rich  effects to  enhance  user interaction and to  capture  a correct attention on a  site. It  covers  about the transition patterns and  purpose  of it.
  
**Principle 6: React Immediately**  
This  chapter  discusses the live response/techniques of  receiving  suggestion  while we are  typing  and also about the auto-completion. It primarily discusses about the  use  of lookup/feedback pattern  on web sites.  
  
It is detailed book that describes  patterns/principles  on interaction  design. It also talks about the  pros/cons of using diverse  pattern. Designing  Web Interface  is a nice to have for everyone who are  involved  in  developing/designing  web sites.

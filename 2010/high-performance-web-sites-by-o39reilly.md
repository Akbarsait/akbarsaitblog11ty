Last week I have completed  reading  [High Performance Web Sites](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596529309?ie=UTF8&tag=coldfusiondevelopers-20&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0596529309) by [Steve  Souders](http://stevesouders.com/bio.php) and published by [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/). This book helps me learn about how to improve the website performance and its response time.
  
Throughout the book Steve has surrounded every chapter with a detail set of examples with proven results like how a page was responding before and after implementing various techniques on improving the performance in websites.

> Performance Golden Rule of the book: Only 10-20% of end user response time is spent in downloading the HTML document. The other 80-90% is spent downloading all the components in the page.

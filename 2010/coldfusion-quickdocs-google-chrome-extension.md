I'm a fan of [CFQuickDocs.com](http://www.cfquickdocs.com/) and I utilize it often for referring the attributes/parameters of the CF tags and functions. At present, CFQuickDocs has plug-ins for Firefox and IE but not for the google chrome. So I created the [ColdFusion QuickDocs Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hggjbdcefbiempledeiecpbmbdbbokcf).

Now the search can be performed easily by hitting the search button after entering the text and selecting the CF version on the extension. Hope this will be helpful. I'd really appreciate your feedback/suggestion or any issues on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hggjbdcefbiempledeiecpbmbdbbokcf" targe="_blank">**ColdFusion QuickDocs Extension**</a>.

Thanks to Jake Munson for the great CFQuickDocs.com site.

Google announced the  [Second  anniversary](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/09/back-to-future-two-years-of-google.html)  for its Chrome browser today and I'm sure that it has completely changed our browsing experience in many ways. I've been  using  Chrome as my  [default browser](/blog/2008/9/3/Google-Chrome-Is-My-Default-Browser)  from the  day  of its  release.

As of now there were more than 6000+ chrome extensions  are available for  [download](https://chrome.google.com/extensions?hl=en-US). In this  place  I have  recorded  some of the  extension  which I have been  using  every  day  in my  work/home.

-   [**Firebug Lite**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bmagokdooijbeehmkpknfglimnifench): Enables  you debug/edit and  inspect  CSS/JavaScript/HTML  in any live web page. The similar functionality can be  achieved  by the in-build web  Developer tool  of Chrome.

-   [**Web Developer Tools**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm): It's includes lots of web developer utilities like viewing CSS, disabling CSS and many more.

-   [**Speed Tracer**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ognampngfcbddbfemdapefohjiobgbdl): Help  us to  identify/fix  the performance issue in the web applications. It includes JS parsing/execution, DOM event handling,  XMLHttpRequest  callbacks and many more.

-   [**Resolution Test**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/idhfcdbheobinplaamokffboaccidbal): Help us to test the Web pages in different screen  resolutions and also allow us to input our own custom  resolution.

-   [**Delicious Bookmarks**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lnejbeiilmbliffhdepeobjemekgdnok?hl=en): I'm a fan of delicious and there are numbers of other Delicious extensions available but this from Yahoo does the job neatly.

-   [**Xmarks Bookmarks**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla): Google Chrome by default allowing a Sync manager with it and which enables you sync all your bookmarks with your different chrome browsers. But to sync your bookmarks with other browsers and  computers  then  Xmarks  stand out there to do the job for you.

-   [**Eye Dropper**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka): Another helpful extension to use to identify the colors in any web you are viewing.

-   [**IE Tabs**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd): We knew there were still many only viewable sites in IE and Chrome helps here in solving that issue without the need for an Internet Explorer browser in your system.

-   [**ColdFusion QuickDocs**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hggjbdcefbiempledeiecpbmbdbbokcf): ColdFusion QuickDocs allows you to search for any ColdFusion Tags and Functions reference for ColdFusion versions 7, 8 and 9 at the CFQuickDocs.com. This is extension is developed by me.

-   [**AdBlock**](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom): Helps to fix the annoying ads in the web sites and other unnecessary heavy Flash elements.

Do you have some other useful chrome extensions that you have been using in Chrome daily? Please share them in the comments.

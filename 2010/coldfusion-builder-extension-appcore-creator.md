[AppCore  Creator](https://github.com/Akbarsait/cfappcorefiles  "https://github.com/Akbarsait/cfappcorefiles")  Is my submission for the CFBuilder contest  by  [Raymond Camden](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/d%3A/Projects/weblabs/akbarsait-11tychirpy/content/posts/2010/www.raymondcamden.com  "www.raymondcamden.com"). The Extension will be used to generate Core CF Application files which include Application.cfc, Error Handler and Missing Template handler  files  for  ColdFusion  MX 7,  ColdFusion  8 and 9 versions. The  extension  performs  file  copy operation form  extension  location  to the  new  location.

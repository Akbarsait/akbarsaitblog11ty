Code formatting is a nice utility to align codes with tabs for better readability. CF Builder by default includes an HTML Tidy Code Formatter which does the formatting of HTML codes perfectly. We can utilize this feature in HTML files by right clicking on the editor and selecting**"Run HTML Tidy"**.

Note: The feature is available only for HTML pages not for the HTML codes in CFM or other pages.

[ColdFusion Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/  "http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/") is available at the  [Adobe stores](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/buy/#cfb  "http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/buy/#cfb") starting today. ColdFusion builder  has been significantly improved in  performance  after the beta releases. I've been utilizing the beta versions and don't think I will be using any other IDE for ColdFusion development. My favorite feature is developing  [Extensions](http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&id=14  "http://www.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=page.category&id=14")  using ColdFusion is absolutely  an  brilliant one.

ColdFusion Builder now includes Flash Builder 4 Standard version in if for the same price.

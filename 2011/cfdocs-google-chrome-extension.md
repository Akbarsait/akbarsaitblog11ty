[CFDocs.org](http://cfdocs.org/ "http://cfdocs.org/")  is  one of the  sites  I  visit often for  ColdFusion tags/functions  docs. Like my  Google chrome extension  for  [CFQuickDocs](http://goo.gl/pGMxO  "http://goo.gl/pGMxO")  I  thought  of  creating  one for  CFDocs  as well so  I  created  this little  Google  Chrome  extension  for CFDocs.org.

[CFDocs  Google Chrome extension](http://goo.gl/QnYhY  "http://goo.gl/QnYhY")  lets  you  search  for a  ColdFusion tag  or function by just entering the  keyword  and  hitting  the  search  button. CFDocs  extension transfers you to the  CFDocs site  to display the  result of your search. I  hope  this  extension  will be helpful.  

Thanks  to Pete  Freitag  for this super-Fast CFDocs.org site.

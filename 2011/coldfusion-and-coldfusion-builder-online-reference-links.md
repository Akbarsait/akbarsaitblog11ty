Typically finding the  ColdFusion  Builder and  ColdFusion  9 documentation on adobe site is a bit difficult for me. To make a note for myself and other  CF developers,  letâ€™s  access  the  [Adobe ColdFusion 9 Family](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html "http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html") page and click [Help and support](http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/ "http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/") link. In that page you will find both ColdFusion/CF Builder online help links under Getting Started & Help section.

Another way to reach the documentation is through the ColdFusion Developer Center page as below.

![ColdFusion & ColdFusion Builder Help & Support](/assets/images/blog/CFHelp4.png "ColdFusion & ColdFusion Builder Help & Support")

 For  now  keep  remembering  this simple **[ColdFusion support](http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/  "http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/")** URL. I  believe it will be easier in  finding  the online  docs  for ColdFusion/CF Builder anymore.

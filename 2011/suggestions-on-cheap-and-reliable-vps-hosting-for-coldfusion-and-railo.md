Currently, I am using shared ColdFusion hosting for mine and friends sites. These are running ok but I'm looking for more reliable one that helps to host as many websites as I want with an affordable price. Also, I'm in a plan of transferring some of these sites to Railo.

In brief, I am seeking your valuable suggestion on Cheap, Best and Reliable VPS Hosting provider for ColdFusion and Railo hosting.

First blog post from the super fast 11ty. Switching from the blogCFC engine is not the what I wanted but thought of giving a try with SSG which went well and smooth.

Migration of contents went easier than expected and was able to figure out some most thorough approach on handling files and processing data in SSG especially in 11ty. I will be publishing some notes about the process in a couple of upcoming post. I was using blogCFC from 2008 and made sleek styling in 2009 [BlogCFC Redesign](/blog/2009/1/13/blogcfc-redesign/). After 14 years now switching to the jamstack. Thanks to [Raymond Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com/) for being the inspiration for utilizing both these tools. 

akbarsait.com is powered by the amazing [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) version of the popular [Chirpy Jekyll](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) blog theme by [Rene](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/eleventy-chirpy-blog-template).

Like last year, the team at  [Agile Arizona](https://agilearizona.org/)  has scheduled the event for this year as well. I'm going to attend this year event and looking forward to meeting the like-minded folks at Phoenix Area.

Here is the intro from the team - Agile Arizona is a full-day regional conference for Scrum and Agile practitioners, coaches, trainers and enthusiasts. Agile Arizona 2017 is the follow-up to the successful inaugural event, with the goal of providing an affordable full day experience that mixes passionate people, great ideas, and industry best practices in a unique and creative setting.

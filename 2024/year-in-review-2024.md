As 2024 comes to an end, I’m excited to share some personal achievements and milestones from this year.

**Blog Upgrade**

My blog was [upgraded](/blog/2023/12/09/blog-poweredby-11ty/) to the 11ty framework. This change improved performance and simplified content management.

**Professional Certifications**

I earned the [SAFe Certified Scrum Master certification](/blog/2024/01/15/scaledagile-safe-ssm-certification/) in January 2024. In June, I achieved the Microsoft [Fabric Analytics Engineer](/blog/2024/06/10/microsoft-certified-fabri-analytics-engineer/) certification, marking progress in my focus on Azure and Fabric Analytics.These certifications have equipped me with valuable knowledge to deliver impactful solutions in my roles.

**Career Milestone**

After around 10 years of association with American Express as a consultant, I began a new role in June 2024 as a [Scrum Master and Technical Project Management](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akbarsait/) consultant with FCB. This transition marks a significant milestone in my career, allowing me to apply my expertise in a dynamic and collaborative environment.

**Home Automation Journey**

This year, I delved deeper into the home automation using Home Assistant. Starting with simple automations like scheduling lights and temperature adjustments, I quickly progressed to more advanced setups, integrating various devices for seamless functionality. To share my learning, I’ve documented examples of these setups on my [GitHub - https://github.com/Akbarsait/smarthome-assistant](https://github.com/Akbarsait/smarthome-assistant). 

As I look back, 2024 has been a year of growth, learning, and new achievements. I am excited to carry this momentum into 2025 and explore new opportunities for personal and professional development.

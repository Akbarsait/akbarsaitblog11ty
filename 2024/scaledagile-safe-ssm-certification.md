First post of the year on my 11ty blog:-). Over this weekend, I completed the [SAFe Scrum Master certfication](https://www.credly.com/badges/3a7f511c-f0f1-4200-8410-dc33cf95dfc8). Presently been part of the SAFe journey at work for four years, however the certification provided more coverage on the theoretical aspect of it.

I completed [SAFe Agilist](https://www.credly.com/badges/12443dfe-7852-452f-b8d1-cf1191a3fd60) certification from Scaled Agile back in 2017 and this one adds to same SAFe family. In addition, this was my second Scrum Masters after my [CSM certification](https://bcert.me/bc/html/show-badge.html?b=yjgrufa) from Scrum Alliance in 2014. 

Happy certfications!!!

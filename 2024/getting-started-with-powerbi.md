Microsoft's Power BI is a centralized business intelligence application. It enables us to connect various data sources such as CSV files, databases (cloud or on-premises), transform and visualize data. Additionally, it facilitates easy sharing reports and visuals with other users. Power BI comprises four main components.


- **Power BI Desktop**: A windows installer free to download for building visuals, reports and Dashboards. 
- **Power BI Service**: An online software as a service (SaaS) service.  
- **Power BI Mobile apps** for Windows, iOS, and Android devices
- **Power BI Report Server**: Allows to publish Power BI reports to an on-premises report server. 

I am planning to share some quick hints and tips on using Power BI, which can serve as a helpful reference for self-learning and other enthusiasts interested in learning. Below are some links for downloads and quick reads to check out before we start exploring.

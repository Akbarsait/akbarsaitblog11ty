This weekend, I completed the [Microsoft Fabric Analytics Engineer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/users/akbarnoor/credentials/149a82bf2fc5fc55?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2F) certification. The exam is challenging, but continuous exploration of Fabric features through labs and the use of Microsoft Learn helped me pass it on the first attempt.

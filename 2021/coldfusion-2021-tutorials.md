Every release of ColdFusion is a ceremony to the CF community. Like the previous release, I started to create this new list for  [the 2021 release of ColdFusion](/cfmltutorials/cf2021tutorials/). The CF 2021 list will get updated as soon as articles are published. I hope it will be handy to see a collection of tutorials on a single page for folks like me.

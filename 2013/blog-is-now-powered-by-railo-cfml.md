I moved my blog from CF 8 and SQL Server to Railo and MySQL as backend three months before. The migration went very smooth and till date I didn't have any issues. Since I'm using blogCFC for my blog I didn't do much on the coding front rather the changes happened on the SQL Server to MySQL conversion only. I would like to thank  [Charlie Arehart](http://www.carehart.org/)  for helping and Jordon & Mark from  [Viviotech](https://www.viviotech.net/)  for providing the hosting for my site.

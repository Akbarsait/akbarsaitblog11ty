Starting this week, I'll be publishing the new CFML This Week, Weekly Newsletter. It will hit your mail box every week with the news, links and code shared by the amazing CFML community around the globe. Please do subscribe with the Tinyletter link below to get your weekly dose of CFML news every week. The Issues #1 is ready and will be released in next 2 hours :-)  [**https://tinyletter.com/cfmlweekly**](https://tinyletter.com/cfmlweekly)  

PS: As like you all I'm also a huge fan of Weekly newsletters. Since the CFML Weekly newsletter by Pete Freitag was not quite active for some time, I have started this newsletter and I hope Pete and the CFML Community will support this initiative.

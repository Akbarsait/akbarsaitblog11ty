I'm sure you have a few things on your &quot;to do&quot; list, how about showing the name of the location/town on the results page? I hope the site gets lots of hits. Are you tracking how many people apply for each job, for your own statistical purposes of course?","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"9417D05365408F","parentPostId":"null","date":"2013-11-25","author":"akbarsait","avatar":"","message":"@Gary\r\n\r\nThanks for the encouraging feedback. In order to simplify the listing display in the main screen, i have limited the details in main page and included those in the individual job details page. Yes currently I'm tracking the internal page clicks. Also the next version will have some additional social integration / twitter posting ect.","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"796359AB3EF949","parentPostId":"null","date":"2013-12-10","author":"Ajo Koshy Joseph","avatar":"","message":"Wonderful Site !!!

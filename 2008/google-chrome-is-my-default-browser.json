I downloaded it and used it (along with Firefox) for my testing and I was very impressed.  Just think - this is only a beta.  It handled ajax cfgrids very quickly and behaved very efficiently throughout the course of my night session.  This is an awesome browser and they hit the nail on the head in terms of being more application focused.","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"1CBBBD2DA7843D","parentPostId":"null","date":"2008-09-03","author":"Akbarsait","avatar":"","message":"Great to hear Andy :-)","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"596953A0812A09","parentPostId":"null","date":"2008-09-03","author":"KP","avatar":"","message":"Yes, all the mentioned features are cool.\n\nBut, 2 drawbacks as of now:\n1. no STOP button.\n2. no HOME button.","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"2AA624368F948C","parentPostId":"null","date":"2008-09-03","author":"Shane Zehnder","avatar":"","message":"Actually, there is a Home button you just need to go into options and enable it to show it on the tool bar","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"FE5107A27642A8","parentPostId":"null","date":"2008-09-03","author":"Akbarsait","avatar":"","message":"Hi KP,\n\nI have updated my post with the keyboard shortcut links for various Google chrome features. As Shane mentioned you can enable Home button in options by checking &quot;Show Home button on the toolbar&quot; and to stop page load you can use &quot;Esc&quot; key as per http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95743.","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"3CA8992535400F","parentPostId":"null","date":"2008-09-03","author":"Andy Matthews","avatar":"","message":"You can also go to the &quot;home page&quot; by clicking ALT + Home.\n\nOne thing that I don't like is there's no way to get the URL of a page inside a frame or an iFrame. There's also no right click and reload.","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"C18658B9483F6F","parentPostId":"null","date":"2008-09-04","author":"Mim","avatar":"","message":"Nice read...\nChrome speeds are avergae according to few tests, have a look\n\nhttp://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080902/first-test-of-googles-new-browser/\n\nhttp://minmaxmim.blogspot.com/2008/09/chrome-setting-internet-alive.html\n\nCheers,\nmim","replies":"[]"}]}}

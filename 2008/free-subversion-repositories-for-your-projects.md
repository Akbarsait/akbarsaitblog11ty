There are various Free Subversion repositories spaces available for hosting our projects in the web among them here i would like to share some with great features. I had been using  [Assemble.com](http://www.assemble.com/ "http://www.assemble.com")  Subversion repository for one of my project and they had offered 500 MB of free private repository space but currently Assemble.com have stopped offering free private repositories. Here are the other alternatives for free Private Subversion repositories.

-   **[XP-Dev](http://xp-dev.com/ "http://xp-dev.com/")**: Easy setup and will allow you to create up to 5 repositories each with 300 MB of size. Allow you to create both public and private repositories with SSL access.

-   **[Unfuddle](http://unfuddle.com/home "http://unfuddle.com/home")**: Unfuddle is offering 200 MB of free private repository space without SSL feature but the have bundle of other features such as issue tracking, milestones, messages, RSS and iCal access.
-   **[OpenSVN](https://opensvn.csie.org/ "https://opensvn.csie.org/")**: OpenSVN allows you to create your project repository with unlimited space with both the private and public access and SSL option. It doesnâ€™t have the features trac or wiki.
-   **[Google Code](http://code.google.com/hosting/ "http://code.google.com/hosting/")**: Google project hosting is easy to setup and having feature of unlimited space for projects with private and public access with SSL options. It also includes wiki, trac, milestones options with repository.

Chennai ColdFusion User Group Next Meeting is on July 25, 2008 and will discuss about CF Software Architecture for Web 2.0. In this session  [Simon Free](http://www.simonfree.com/ "http://www.simonfree.com/")  will discuss how best to architect your CF code so that it can be easily extended to be used with the default CF8 AJAX features, as well as Flex and Lifecycle. Simon will take a simple application and see what steps you must take to extend it to work in these technologies.

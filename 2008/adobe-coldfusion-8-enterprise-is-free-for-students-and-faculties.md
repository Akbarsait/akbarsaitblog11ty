Finally following the Flex way Adobe announces ColdFusion is Free for Students and Faculties. This will help many of us in promoting ColdFusion to Colleges and Institutions. Especially in India it will be big booster for us to take ColdFusion to students and Computer Science faculties. Thanks Adobe for this great announcement.

AIR 1.1 has been released! And available at:  [http://get.adobe.com/air/](http://get.adobe.com/air/ "http://get.adobe.com/air/")

The major change in this version is support for localized and internationalized applications. The AIR runtime itself now supports multiple languages (Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish), as well as support for building internationalized applications (including keyboard input for double-byte languages).

Meanwhile, over in the Labs, there's an Adobe AIR Update Framework just out:**

This beta release of the update framework for Adobe AIR applications provides APIs to help developers offer good update capabilities in their AIR applications.

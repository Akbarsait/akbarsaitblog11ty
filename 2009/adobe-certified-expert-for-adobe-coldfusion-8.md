I wanted to share that I completed my ColdFusion 8 Certification and became an Adobe certified expert for ColdFusion 8 from today. I completed the examination in an hour. For preparation, spent a half-hour daily to learn insights of the tags/functions and that took me two months for the certification preparation. Having that said, Iâ€™m happy with this achievement as an ACE for ColdFusion 8.

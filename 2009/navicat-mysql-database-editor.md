Tried and utilized some database administration tools for MySQL, but I felt like something was missing. Recently, started using <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat </a> for MySQL db management tool that provides what I required. It contains features that can be used to manage databases with a minimal amount of time.

Some of the key features of Navicat that I liked are transferring data between local and remote databases, visual editor, form viewer, schedule task, data and object dump features and many more. Also using Navicat, we can connect to multiple databases like MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL simultaneously. There is a free Non-commercial <a href="http://www.navicat.com/en/download/download.html">**Lite version**</a> version is available for download with limited features. 

What editors are you using for your MySQL database management? For me Navicat is an excellent utility that performs database management/administration easier.

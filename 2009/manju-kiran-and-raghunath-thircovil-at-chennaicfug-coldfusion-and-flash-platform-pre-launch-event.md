Yesterday,  **[Manju Kiran](http://www.manjukiran.net/)**  and  **[Raghunath Thircovil](http://raghuonflex.wordpress.com/)**  came to the  **[Chennai ColdFusion User Group](http://groups.adobe.com/groups/8b55ef4ef4/summary)** for the Adobe ColdFusion/Flash Platform UG Tour. Since it's  a one-day event, we  had  the  sessions  on  Flash platform  and ColdFusion. The event hall is jam-packed with more then 80+ attendees from both the  ColdFusion  and  Flex community  from Chennai. Raghu  started  the Event at 10:30 AM, and he  talked  about the awesome features of  Flash  Builder 4 and  Flash  Catalyst with  lots  of  demos. 

After Raghu's presentation, Manju started the session on ColdFusion and Bolt. He demoed various features of upcoming release and continues his session post lunch to address questions from attendees.

They are spreadsheets/powerpoint integration, ORM, CFScript, CFCs enhancement with the import and new keyword. IMAP access to retrieve and manage Emails, attachments and folders, ColdFusion multi-server manager, Bolt IDE features and extension for ORM Code generator. Raghu subsequently introduced his hands-on session on employing Flash builder with ColdFusion and other server side technologies. The interactive session received well followed by questions from attendees.

The event was a massive success with lots of questions, networking with community members. A very big thanks to Raghunath Thircovil and Manju Kiran for delivering such an incredible presentation. Thanks to adobe for sponsoring the event.

I would also like to thank Mohamed Khan and Ali Asghar of **[Esberi](http://esberi.com/)** and Shahjahan Gani of **[RIA Digital Solutions](http://www.riadigitalsolutions.com/)** for Co-Sponsoring the Event.

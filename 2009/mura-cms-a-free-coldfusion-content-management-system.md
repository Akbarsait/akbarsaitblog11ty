After  reading  many blog  post  about  [Mura CMS](http://www.getmura.com/ "http://www.getmura.com/"),  Yesterday I  downloaded  and  installed to  explore it. Mura CMS is  stunning  with tons  of  features  included. It makes  building, deploying/maintaining web sites and its contents extremely  simpler. Apart from its excellent features/functionalities,  Mura CMS, is open source and Free.

Mura  comes  with two  types  of  downloads.
- Mura Standard: Require  Adobe ColdFusion/Railo installed with a  supporting database  like MySQL/MSSQL.
- Mura Express: Runs on our  machine  without any server  requirements.

Installing/setting up Mura is simple that requires only five minutes. The installation is clearly documented but for a quick reference. I am capturing the installation steps for reference.

-   Download Mura Standard from  [here](http://www.getmura.com/index.cfm/download/mura-downloads/index.cfm "http://www.getmura.com/index.cfm/download/mura-downloads/index.cfm")
-   Copy the contents of "www" directory from the downloaded Mura CMS and put that into your systems webroot.
-   Create a new database ex: muradb and Create a data source connection in CF Admin ex:muradsn and connect it to the muradb database.
-   Browse to the URL of installed Mura site and follow the steps.

Done. We  completed  the  installations  and Mura is ready for to  manage  your web sites.

ColdFusion Builder provides a new option to set default contents in the newly created cfm/cfc files. These features are helpful to capture some regular code blocks.

We can use this feature by placing the contents at ColdFusion Editor Section. 
> Open **Preferences > ColdFusion > Editor Profiles > Editor**

I have defined my default CFM file name and I placed the above code in "Initial CFM Content section" which we normally used in many CFM display pages and you can also set your frequently used contents in this section. This feature is applicable for CFC files as well. Do you think this feature is helpful? For me this is really a handy feature. ColdFusion Builder Rocks!

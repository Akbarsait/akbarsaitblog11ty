At every chapter, there is a case study associated and which tells about the story of two imaginary peoples who recently head-down to the freelancing path. The story is arranged in a progressive manner based on that chapter and informs about how both of them are moving towards in the freelance world. This is one of the excellent approaches we can find in the book. The book includes interviews of well-known authors in freelancing and captures their experience/challenges, work-life balance, achievement, and managing cash flow/finance in their field.

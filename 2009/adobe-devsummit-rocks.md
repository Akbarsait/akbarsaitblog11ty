On Tuesday, August 4th, I attended the Adobe devsummit at bangalore. This is my first experience at Adobe Devsummit and all I want to assert is that the event was extremely awesome and amazing. There were more than 1200 participants attended the event, the event location/arrangements are effectively managed. The event was powered by Ben Forta and Serge Jespers keynote presentations about the Flash Platform, ColdFusion, Mobile platform with demos.

It  was  pleasant experience to  meet  the super friendly ColdFusion  team members Manju  Kiran,  Hemant  Khandelwal, Bhakti  Pingale,  Vamseekrishnan,  Malika. List  continues  with flash platform evangelist  Ramesh, Harish and so many more at the  event. Underneath remain the collection of some photos from the event.

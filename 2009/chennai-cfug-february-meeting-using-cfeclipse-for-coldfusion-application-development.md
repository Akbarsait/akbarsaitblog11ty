Chennai ColdFusion User Group is having a meeting about using CFEclipse for ColdFusion Application development on coming February 14.  In this meeting I'm presenting about using ColdFusion 8 Eclipse debugger, CRUD Wizard, using Snippets and about using the available plug-ins with CFEclipse that makes the ColdFusion application development and deployment easy.

Iâ€™m  delighted  to  announce  another  ColdFusion Cookbook contest, as we all  know  Adobe recently launched the  new [**ColdFusion Cookbook**](http://cookbooks.adobe.com/coldfusion "http://cookbooks.adobe.com/coldfusion")   section. As of now it includes 123 great recipes. Therefore inviting all the  ColdFusion developers  to  achieve the next target of 200 ColdFusion recipes.

To encourage the Cookbook contribution, we are conducting a contest, and the details are same as Ed announcement for 100 ColdFusion recipes contests. Once the target of 200 contributions, drawing for the CF WACK and CF 8 Developer Tutorial books will be initiated. If you contributed five of the 101-200 recipes, you would have five entries; if you contribute 10 of the 101-200, you have the chance for 10 entries. So submit more and share your recipes to Win ColdFusion Books.

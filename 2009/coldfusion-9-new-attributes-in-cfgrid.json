Right now the default behavior is for all of the groups to be expanded.  If I could have them collapsed by default it would help my layout tremendously.\n\nIf you have any info it would be greatly appreciated.  If not thanks anyway and have a good one.\n\nSteve","replies":"[]"},{"postId":"ADBBA33A650DC6","parentPostId":"null","date":"2011-09-12","author":"Sebastiaan ","avatar":"","message":"Akbarsait, Unfortunately the collapsible thing only works for non-dynamic grids, so not for grids being populated via a Bind.

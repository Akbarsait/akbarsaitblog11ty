As part of my learning in UX design I finished reading the  ["A Project Guide to UX Design"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321607376?ie=UTF8&tag=coldfusiononweb20-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321607376), written by Russ Unger and Carolyn Chandler and Published by  [Peachpit Press](http://www.peachpit.com/). This is one of the first books in UX design category that I read recently. However, the book provided a immense number of ideas on how to create and deliver UX projects, integrating UX designs, adopting best practices.

From starting to end every chapter in the book is well written and covers on various sections like Project Ecosystem, Project type identification, writing project proposal, doing user Research and transition of the project defining to designing and so on.

A  chapter  on  project proposal  for Freelancers/consultants  covers  all the core components of writing a  proposal  from  defining  a  title  to the payment schedule. Acknowledgment/project  sign-off and what need to be  included  in each and every  part  of the  project proposal. The chapters 4 & 5 describe about the setting up project objectives and different project approaches of including the familiar steps to include in every Project Plan. Like,  define, design,  develop,  deploy  and  extend. Another  chapter  on Business  requirements  talks about understanding the current state of the  project  and how to prioritize  requirements  based  on the  objective. It also covers on how to arrange and conduct the meeting effectively.

A  chapter  on  UX  design and SEO  explains  about the  ideas  of optimizing Flash, Ajax, JavaScript and other scripted contents for  search engines. Understanding  the  meta  tags  like  defining  a page title,  meta  keywords,  meta  description, "noindex"  meta  tag, header, cross-linking, Footer links, etc., are clearly  defined  in this  chapter.

This book also gets in length on including the fundamental elements of site maps, creating advanced site maps and task flows for web sites and applications. It also includes a chapter on creating a wireframe for a web application from a basic level by defining different sections on the wireframe and using annotations in wireframes.  

Overall this book is carefully designed, extremely practical and valuable guide for recognizing every aspect of UX design and team collaboration and meetings, planning and managing great UX projects.

ColdFusion Builder Beta 3 is now available at  [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusionbuilder/ "http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusionbuilder/"). This release includes many new  [features](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/ColdFusion_Builder "http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/ColdFusion_Builder")  and one of my favorite is AIR Application development support. Some of the new features included with this release are as follows.

-   Code Assist for ColdFusion ORM
-   Enhanced SQL Editor
-   AIR application development
-   Support for ExtJS 3.0 libraries

So don't wait to grab your copy. ColdFusion Builder Rocks!

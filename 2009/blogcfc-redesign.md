As part of 2009 task lists and to improve my knowledge in web design, I planned to change my blog UI. Hence, I played with the BlogCFC code and want to say it's incredibly painless to change the entire theme and implement a new template for the blog. All the credits go to [ColdFusion Jedi](http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/ "http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/") for his brilliant BlogCFC project to CF community. I used [styleshout](http://www.styleshout.com/ "http://www.styleshout.com/") template for the theme and modified the design according to my interest. Let me know what you think about this change and thank you for reading my post.

There are many ColdFusion 9 and ColdFusion Builder tutorials are hitting the blogosphere from the ColdFusion community after the release of ColdFusion 9 and ColdFusion Builder betas. Just to categorize these articles, blog post, tutorials of ColdFusion 9 and ColdFusion Builder beta I'm aggregating all the entries in my blog for CF community reference. I have created two sections in my blog one for  [**ColdFusion 9 tutorials**](http://www.akbarsait.com/cf9tutorials.cfm "http://www.akbarsait.com/cf9tutorials.cfm")  and another one for  [**ColdFusion Builder tutorials**](http://www.akbarsait.com/cfbuildertutorials.cfm "http://www.akbarsait.com/cfbuildertutorials.cfm"). I don't know whether this will be helpful for the community but I'm putting this because someone like me will surely get benefit.

I welcome any  [**suggestions, corrections and inputs**](http://www.akbarsait.com/blog/contact.cfm "http://www.akbarsait.com/blog/contact.cfm")  form the Community on the aggregating entries.
